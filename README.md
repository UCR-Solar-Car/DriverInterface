# Driver-Interface-2022

Welcome to the Driver Interface for UCR Solar Car 2023! The driver interface is run with QT C++ to create an 
interactive GUI display to display various kinds of system critical information. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/UCR-Solar-Car/DriverInterface/wiki) page for 
more information! 

## Software Requirments/Regulations
- [ ] 11.7 Radios/Communication – Driver in radio contact with team, hands free
- [ ] 9.8 Data logger – position for exposure to sky and fixed in position
- [ ] 8.2.C Supplemental Batteries[Allowed for] – radios, meters, driver fan, main power switch, horn only, BPS momentarily, fans in BPS trip, BPS Strobe, BPS Fault Driver Indicator
- [ ] 8.8.B Accelerator – zero return, brake shutoff on cruise control"
- [ ] 8.8.A Control – driver has sole control
- [ ] 8.8.C Cruise Control - If the solar car is equipped with cruise control, it can only be activated by the driver. The cruise control must be designed to automatically deactivate when the brake controls are manually actuated by the driver, or when the car is shut off- [ ] 12.4.A-12.4.E GPS for observer viewing ONLY for Chase
- [ ] 12.5 Radios / Communication - The team must be in two-way radio communication with the solar car driver at all times. Communications should be maintained between the solar car, the pit area, and the timing area at all times.
Driver communication requirements are found in section 11.6. Cell phones MAY be allowed as the primary
communications device during the Track Event, depending on line-of-sight obstructions to 2-way radio
communication at the track selected for the event.
- [ ] 12.5 Separate CB channel for ASC communications in all vehicles on routed
- [ ] 8.6.B BPS(Battery Protection System) Fault Dash Indication - The driver is to have an illuminated dash indication of a BPS fault to provide warning of an automatic opening of the Main Power Switch. (Penalty for ignoring it)
- [ ] 8.8.D Reverse - The solar car must be able to be driven backwards under its own power with the driver seated in the normal position.
- [ ] 8.10.E When charging from an external energy source the BPS must always actively monitor the battery state 
- [ ] 9.4.A Operations: The Daytime Running Lights shall operate whenever driving is possible (motor
power is enabled)
- [ ] 9.4.B.2 Front Turn Indicators - Shall flash between 60 and 120 pulses per minute
- [ ] 9.4.C.s Side Marker Turn Indicators - Shall flash between 60 and 120 pulses per minute
- [ ] 9.4.D Rear Brake Lights - 9.4.D.2 It is permissible to have one set of lights per side of the car which operate as both the brake lights and turn indicators. The turn indicator operation has the priority in operation.
- [ ] 9.4.E.3 Rear Turn Indicators - 9.4.E.3 Shall flash between 60 and 120 pulses per minute AND SAME AS ONE ABOVE
- [ ] 9.4.F High Mounted Center Brake Light -  It is to activate any time the Battery Protection System (BPS) actuates to
automatically open the Main Power Switch and remain active while the BPS fault is present. Flashes 60 to 120 pulse per minute 
- [ ] 9.4.H Emergency Hazard - The front turn indicators, side marker turn indicators, and rear turn indicators shall be able to be activated simultaneously and flash in sync as an Emergency Hazard signa
- [ ] 9.4.I Horn - Solar cars shall be equipped with a horn that can be heard at a sound power level between 75 and 102 dBA at a distance of 15 m in front of the solar car. The horn shall be permanently mounted, operated from thesteering wheel, and shall be able to operate for up to 5 minutes continuously at the required volume."
- [ ] 9.5.D.1 Solar cars must have a method to clear the windshield from any falling rain such that the vision
requirements of Reg. 9.5.B can be met.(Can use a hydrophobic coating or electrically power wiper)
- [ ] 9.5.E Rear Vision - All solar cars must be equipped with a rear-view system that at all times will allow the driver to see a vehicle 15 m directly behind the solar car and up to 30° off center. The system must provide the
driver with a single reflex type image and must operate without driver input. The driver will be required to
identify the direction of an arrow with a 200 mm thick brush stoke on a 1 m2
board held about 1 m off the ground.
- [ ] 12.13.A Speed Limit - No solar car shall exceed the maximum speed of 104.2 km/h (65 mph), unless further restricted by the Officials per Reg. 10.9.B anywhere on the track.
- [ ] 12.13.C ... In no case shall regenerative braking be engaged while pushing or pulling the solar car.
